  <h1>CSCE 412 Trip to CGM CGA in Marseille</h1>
  
  <p>Our CSCE 412 Cloud Computing trip to CGM CGA in Marseille was both enlightening and very fun. We woke up at the crack of dawn to make the bus ride, which was short, sweet, and very scenic. Upon arrival, we were greeted by employees who led us downstairs to a quick reception.</p>

  <p>After the reception, we were led to a small auditorium where the presentation began. Numerous high-level speakers presented, each presentation more interesting than the next. The presentations included topics on reducing climate emissions, ship efficiency, tracking technologies, and more.</p>

  <p>I asked a couple of questions relating to shipping logistics and the efficacy of nuclear energy in container ships.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, we Ubered to central Marseille and had a delicious lunch at a brunch place. We walked around the harbor for a while before walking back to CGM CGA and departing.</p>
